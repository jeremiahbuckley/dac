# Introduction
The original ideas come from Alex Tabarrok and Yaseen Mowzer

It is much better explained above, but a very short introduction is: 

A Dominant Assurance Contract is a fundraising mechanism where, in the event the funding threshold is not met, the backers will get a refund plus an extra reward for their support. The reward mechanism is to encourage interested but dispassionate funders to fund the effort rather than hold their money and wait for someone else to complete the funding (a.k.a. freeloading).

# Terms
Terms defined below. Initially these are derived from the original paper (Tabarrok, 1998). Some terms have a very "game theory" flavor and may benefit from being reworded to be more palatable to users who do not have time to read the paper:

**Dominant Assurance Contract** - (1). An assurance contract where the equilibrium is to contribute to funding the public good as a dominant strategy. (2). An assurance contract where funders are offered a refund plus a reward if the contract fails, in order to encourange funders to commit to the contract.

**Assurance Contract** - A contract where the owner pledges to take action / create a good if a given minimum threshhold of contributions are made. 
Example: If $10000 is raised by the community, a contractor will build a road. If the minimum is not raised, the contractor does nothing.

Note that in this framework, the contract does not mean "build a road", the contract is the agreement to do something if a threshhold is met.

**Success** - The contract minimum threshold is met.

**Failure** - The contract minimum threshold is not met before the contract expires.

**Entrepeneur** - The person who offers the Contract.

**Agent** - A person, one of many presumably, who choose to fund or reject the contract.

**Accept** - An individual Agent chooses to fund the contract.

**Reject** - An individual Agent chooses to reject the contract.

**Failure Payoff** - A payoff given by the Entrepeneur to an Agent who has Accepted a Contract that Fails. Note, if the Success Fee is $100, and the Failure Payoff is $5, the Agent does not forfeit $100 and get $5 back as a Failure Payoff, they forfeit nothing and profit $5 with the Failure Payoff.

**Success Fee** - A fee given by an Agent to the Entrepeneur if the Agent has Accepted a Contract and the Contract Succeeds.

**Acceptance Threshold** - The value at which the contract is said to succeed. Either by reaching a monetary funding minumum (Accepting Agents * Success Fee) or reaching a minimum number of Accepting Agents. (If Agents can fund at varying amounts, then it is possible to meet a minimum monetary threshold but at the same time not meet a minimum threshold for number of Accepting Agents).

**Contract Expiration** - The date at which a Contract ends and, if the Acceptance Threshold has not been met, becomes a Failed Contract.
